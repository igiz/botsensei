# Sensei - A Slackbot 
A slack bot with a purpose of helping the first day employees survive the day. The idea of this bot is to provide a common set of tasks for a new join based on the role they are in. It can also be used as a personal assistant to ask commonly asked questions. Can be extended to have any number of questions.

**Pre-setup**

 - Create a **.env** in the root folder of the bot with the following variables:

>    **BOT_TOKEN**= The slack authentication token

>    **BOT_NAME**= The name of the bot

**Running the bot:**
